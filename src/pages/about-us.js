                  My name is Zalmai Zazai, and I am the owner and lead developer
                  at Seattle Pixels. I hold a bachelors degree in computer
                  science, specializing in software engineering. My journey in
                  tech started with desktop-based applications, but after moving
                  to the U.S. in 2021, I realized the immense demand for web
                  applications. I quickly adapted and mastered modern web
                  development technologies like React and Next.js. I found that
                  many small businesses face the same struggle: either they can
                  not afford a quality website, or if they do, they end up with
                  an outdated, poorly designed site. To solve this, I created a
                  business model that caters to their needsâ€”a $0 down payment
                  with a manageable $150 per month. This way, small businesses
                  can get a professional, modern website without breaking the
                  bank. At Seattle Pixels, I am committed to designing and
                  developing websites that not only look great but also function
                  with intent and purpose, using cutting-edge tools and
                  technologies to help businesses grow online.
